# Description

> Another weapon I started long ago and never finished. These last two days I've been learning and experimenting at the same time with Marmoset and Substance with all that has to do with the baking process. I've also learnt a lot about the dangers of modeling with too many tris (due to boolean operations) and trying to bake them.
