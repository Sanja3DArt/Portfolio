# Description

> TIto the bunny is the companion of the main character of our videogame: "Hold me, Lulu" ([https://blacklist-gang.itch.io/hold-me-lulu](https://blacklist-gang.itch.io/hold-me-lulu)).

I made everything but the assets of the scenario, which were made by my collegue Aibhill ([https://www.artstation.com/aibhill](https://www.artstation.com/aibhill)).
